## Abstract

Jupyter Notebooks have been around for almost a decade.  Data Scientists use these notebooks to track their experiments.  Software Developers, like scientists, can benefit from using a Code Notebook which combines markdown with code.

## Notes

## Notes by [aminamos](https://github.com/aminamos)
- starting with a history of notebooks, physics/chemistry/art
- can we digitize these notebooks? using digital world for future notetaking
- Donald Knuth - web, tangle, weave
    - http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf 
    - humans think like trees, we have interconnected thoughts
    - code used tangle and weave to connect different parts
- GOTO, difficult to read spaghetti code
- data science jupyter notebooks
- the transition from spaghetti code to low code (not low code like draggable/UI coding, but more highly abstracted code via serverless functions) opens software up to more documentation in notebooks
- example: https://github.com/rebeccapeltz/cascadiajs-notebooks
- keeping notes in context with code allows it to be referenced by yourself, and also others
